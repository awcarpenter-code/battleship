# Game of Battleship in Python

Battleship Game in Python Against a Computer  
# The Project:
This project is a playable battleship game against a computer that will make
pseudo-random turns in order to hit tiles on your grid. At the start of the game, the
player is prompted for where they will place parts of their ships. The computer
places its ships at random. The player and the computer alternate turns. The player
informs the computer if it has hit or sunk a ship and the computer informs the
player of the state of its ships. The player’s grid is displayed with ASCII art, as well
as the computer’s at the end of the game. If time, a more challenging version of the
game, “Salvo”, may be created as an option, where five shots are called instead of
one and the player and computer lose more shots the more damage their ships
have taken.

# Testing:
This game will be tested by playing many games and inputing shots that will miss
and will hit. The location of the player’s and computer’s ships will be printed to test
the conditions when they are hit and sunk. Different positions for parts of each
ship on the grid will also be tested by the player using inputs that place the parts on
a table displayed.

# How a Grader Would Test:
Functions could be tested individually in the shell to ensure that each work
individually and the game could be played multiple times to test conditions for
winning, losing, hitting ships, and sinking ships.
